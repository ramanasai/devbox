# Devbox Setup Guide

This README file provides instructions for setting up Devbox on your system. Devbox is a powerful tool that helps manage development environments, making it easier to work on projects with specific dependencies and configurations.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following:

- A Debian-based Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu).
- Sufficient permissions to install packages and run scripts.

## Installation Steps

Follow these steps to install Devbox and configure your environment:

### Step 1: Update Package Lists

Open your terminal and run the following command to update your package lists. This ensures that you have the latest information about available packages:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

### Step 2: Install Required Packages

Next, install the necessary packages for running Devbox. This includes `curl`, `nano`, and `xz-utils`. Run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install curl nano xz-utils
```

- **curl:** A command-line tool for transferring data with URLs.
- **nano:** A simple text editor for editing configuration files.
- **xz-utils:** A set of tools for handling `.xz` compressed files, required by Devbox.

### Step 3: Install Devbox

Now, you can install Devbox using the following command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.jetify.com/devbox | bash
```

This command downloads and executes the installation script for Devbox. Follow any prompts that may appear during the installation process.

### Step 4: Configure Devbox

After installation, you need to create or edit a configuration file named `devbox.json`. This file defines the packages and settings for your development environment.

To create or edit this file, use the following command:

```bash
nano devbox.json
```

You can add your desired packages and configurations in this JSON file. Hereâ€™s an example of what your `devbox.json` might look like:

```json
{
    "packages": [
        "python@12",
        "node@20",
        "git",
        "fzf"
    ],
    "init_hooks": [
        "echo 'Welcome to your Devbox environment!'"
    ]
}
```

### Step 5: Start Your Devbox Shell

Once you have configured your `devbox.json`, you can start a new Devbox shell by running:

```bash
devbox shell
```

This command will initialize your development environment based on the configurations specified in `devbox.json`.
